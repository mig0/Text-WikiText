<p>There are four types of text formattings defined in WikiText (&lt;--
camelcaps do not indicate a link).  These are <em>emphasis</em>, <strong>strong</strong>,
<u>underline</u>, <strike>strikethrough</strike> and <tt>typewriter font</tt>.
</p>

<p>These text formattings must obey certain rules.  They must enclose the
surrounded text without whitespace: { some text } is not typewriter
font, but &quot;some text&quot; in curly braces.  Use <tt>some text</tt> to generate
typewriter font.
</p>

<p><strong>This disambiguates</strong> inline markup at the start of a paragraph from
environment / paragraph types / (useless slash to confuse the parser).
</p>

<p>Text formatting markup can contain <u>multiple words</u> <strong>and even line
breaks</strong>.  The markup characters may only follow/precede special
characters, such as whitespace and sentence characters (<strong>bold</strong> vs
not_underlined_).
</p>

<p>Mathematical formulas can also confuse the parser:
</p>

<p>a * b * c = c*b*a (nothings bold here)
</p>

<p>a <strong>b</strong> c = c <em>b</em> a (this is markup ... but who'd write like this and
                   not mean it)
</p>

<p>Don't even think about doing inline markups with some s///g
expressions.  The verbatim inline tag doesn't like it. *this* is not
bold but <b>this</b> is.
</p>

<p>Links are simple: <a href="http://google.com/">google-fu</a> or
<a href="http://heise.de/">heise.de</a>. <a href="mailto:dont@bother.me">dont@bother.me</a> is a mailto: link.
</p>

<p>Force image links to be inlined by using <img src="nothing.png" alt="nothing.png" /> or
<img src="nothing.png" alt="an image showing nothing" />.
</p>

<p>With <a href="#google.com">google.com</a> you can generate section links, even if the target
looks like something else.  With <a href="localhost">localhost</a> you can generate
external links, even if the target doesn't seem to be.
</p>

<p>Links and verbatim obey the same rules as the text formatting markups.
