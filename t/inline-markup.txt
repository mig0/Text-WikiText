There are four types of text formattings defined in WikiText (<--
camelcaps do not indicate a link).  These are /emphasis/, *strong*,
_underline_, -strikethrough- and {typewriter font}.

These text formattings must obey certain rules.  They must enclose the
surrounded text without whitespace: { some text } is not typewriter
font, but "some text" in curly braces.  Use {some text} to generate
typewriter font.

*This disambiguates* inline markup at the start of a paragraph from
environment / paragraph types / (useless slash to confuse the parser).

Text formatting markup can contain _multiple words_ *and even line
breaks*.  The markup characters may only follow/precede special
characters, such as whitespace and sentence characters (*bold* vs
not_underlined_).

Mathematical formulas can also confuse the parser:

  a * b * c = c*b*a (nothings bold here)

  a *b* c = c /b/ a (this is markup ... but who'd write like this and
                     not mean it)

Don't even think about doing inline markups with some s///g
expressions.  The verbatim inline tag doesn't like it. {{*this* is not
bold but <b>this</b> is}}.

Links are simple: [http://google.com/|google-fu] or
[heise.de]. [dont@bother.me] is a mailto: link.

Force image links to be inlined by using [=nothing.png] or
[=nothing.png|an image showing nothing].

With [#google.com] you can generate section links, even if the target
looks like something else.  With [>localhost] you can generate
external links, even if the target doesn't seem to be.

Links and verbatim obey the same rules as the text formatting markups.
